PID Controlled Autonomous Line Following Robot

â€¢ The objective of this project is to create an intelligent Arduino robot car that will be able to follow a black or white line with turns. The robot follows line according to the PID algorithm. This project has an industrial scope in which it can be used to transport heavy goods from one place to another staying on adedicated path.
